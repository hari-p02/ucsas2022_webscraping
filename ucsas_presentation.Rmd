# Introduction to Web Scraping

## What is Web Scraping?

- A method of extracting data from a webpage
  - Data is stored in HTML

- Notice that all visible information can be located somewhere in the HTML document


## Data Science Pipeline

## Where does Web Scraping fit in the Data Science Pipeline?

- Web Scraping is intended for the second step of gathering the data
- Allows you to choose your own data source
    - More relevant data

- Not limited to pre-made datasets

- Automate extraction process
    - Reduces a lot of manual work

- Accurate data collection and easy to implement.

- Data is Everywhere
  - We can make out own datasets.
  
## How does Web Scraping Work?
- There are 4 main steps:
1) Find a data source (a webpage)
2) Get the HTML of the webpage
3) Parse through the HTML and locate where specific data is
  - CSS Selectors
4) Store your data

# `Requests` and `BeautifulSoup`

## `Requests`

<center>

![`requests`](./images/requests.png){width=15%}

</center>

- The `requests` library is used to make HTTP GET requests in Python.
  - Can be used to get the HTML document/content of a webpage.

## `BeautifulSoup`

<center>

![`BeautifulSoup`](./images/bsoup.png){width=30%}

</center>

- The `BeautifulSoup` library is used to parse through HTML documents by taking in CSS Selectors.
  - Can locate specific parts of a webpage (useful for extracting data).
  
## `Pandas`

<center>

![`Pandas`](./images/pandas_white.png){width=30%}

</center>

- The `pandas` library is used to store data into a file (.csv, .xlx, etc.).


# `Selenium` and `SQL (sqlite3)`

## `Selenium`

- `Selenium` is used to interact with webpages via creating bots.
  - Uses a chrome executable/driver to interact with a webpage.

## `SQL (sqlite3)`

- SQL (Structured Query Language).
  - A lot of data is stored in databases, SQL allows us to interact with this data.

## Legality of Web Scraping

- Scraping publicly available data (for the most part) is safe
  - Government sites, or other data without restricted access
  
- Sometimes "public" data is not legal to web scrape
